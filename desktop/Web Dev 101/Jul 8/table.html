			<br/><br/>
			"I also had pleasant day. I went working and shopping," Helena says to an imaginary companion across the table, midway through season one of BBC America's Orphan Black. She's alone in the kitchen eating contraband chicken. The effect is blisteringly funny and winds back around to sad. We forget, for a long second, that we're watching a serial killer.
			<br/><br/>
			Helena is the "twin clone" of Orphan Black's protagonist Sarah Manning: Legend has it the embryo split in their surrogate mother's womb and they're mirror images of each other. (Helena's heart is even on the "wrong" side.) This might at first seem to place her in the tradition of the Evil Twin in fiction, and sure enough, she's been stalking and killing her fellow clones in Europe. Prior to killing a target, she dyes a Barbie's hair to match the victim's and beheads it. (Choosing the most reproduced doll in America to represent her clone sisters is pretty brilliant.) She's terrifying. BUT what's surprising is that she's also funny, wishful, and guileless. She strays from the confines of malevolence; She might be a murderer, but she loves Jell-O and wants you to take her to lunch.
			Orphan Black is known for its slick plotting and tornado speed, but Helena's complexity is the show's most interesting innovation - she is that rare species, the Redeemable Female Monster. Helena's male counterpart is relatively common in our fictional wilds - Frankenstein, Edward Cullen, Shrek, the Beast in Beauty and The Beast, and the Phantom from the The Phantom of the Opera all qualify as sometime evildoers capable of redemption. But instead of female monsters we tend to get languishing victims, saints, witches, and the Kill Bill-style avenging fury. Though there's been a recent fad of sympathetically retelling witch stories - Maleficent, Elphaba in Wicked, the witch in Into the Woods - those reclamations work by downplaying the qualities that made them scary. We don't get female Stringer Bells or Walter Whites.
			<br/><br/>
			This is a symptom of a broader tendency to force female pop-culture figures into easy categories - most notably the Strong Female Character. At first glance, Helena might seem too extreme to be a part of the usual conversations about manic pixie dream girls and ice-queen businesswomen and sassy best friends. But within the horror genre, she's doing her part to counteract the feminine conventions we're used to seeing onscreen.
			Feminine horror is often depicted as a function of feminine trauma- Carrie in Carrie, or the revenge-seeking ghost of Mary Feur in What Lies Beneath- and the early episodes of Orphan Black seem to fit this pattern.</td>
			<td colspan="3"> After Sarah stabs Helena in the abdomen, for instance, Helena sort of "unrapes" herself by pulling the phallic bar out and sewing herself up in a parody of a (conventionally feminine) seamstress. This is the kind of familiar symbolism that makes you think you've got a handle on Helena. (There are other familiar horror devices too: the cutting, the shrieky soundtrack, the jump scares, the jealousy over who gets to be the Original.) But she's also weirdly unsexualized. Unlike The Exorcist, which has Regan masturbating with a crucifix, or American Horror Story: Coven, where Zoe liquefies men's brains through sex and Madison wreaks revenge on her rapists by using her powers to overturn the bus, neither Helena's obsession nor her revenge is sex-based. She spends a lot of time covered in blood, her own and others', but it's never (for example) menstrual blood - kind of amazing for a show built around the trilogy of technology, religion, and female reproduction. There are no vagina dentata here, no fetishized virginity.
			<br/><br/>
			Neither is Helena reducible to the story of her abuse — she's a Laura Palmer who refuses to die. Yes, she’s been raped, cut, stabbed, and shot. Her lips have been stitched shut. She has lived in a cage. Her eggs have been harvested. She cut a tail off a man and killed her mother and sisters. And yet the show — while recognizing her monstrosity and fully realizing her potential to inflict terror — doesn’t place her beyond hope. Her superpower isn’t her femininity but her ability to occupy both sides of the horror script: monster and victim.
			<br/><br/>
			In horror, once a person has been cast as a victim, a victim they remain - or at best, a deeply damaged survivor. In Orphan Black, the victim becomes the monster becomes the victim again with bewildering and humorous ease. Just when you think you've settled, the camera cocks its head, says "don't be baby," and refuses to let things be so simple. The camera confounds our relationship to Helena by seesawing the horror script, and in doing so, makes us rethink what a female monster can be. You're forced to shift your sympathies on a shot-by-shot basis.
			To see this in action, let's start with Helena's boots. Helena often gets shot boots-first, and it almost always signifies horror. We see her army boots, and then we see her doing something awful: stitching herself up, or stalking someone, or about to attack.
